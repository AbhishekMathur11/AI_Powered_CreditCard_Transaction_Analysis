# Intelligent-bank-marketing-program
This is a guided project done alongside coursera. It creates an intelligent marketting strategy according to customer classification and segmentation
It makes use of k means clustering algorithm to segment the customers into categories
Optimization of cluster numbers is done using the elbow method
Finally, it employs PCA method to analyse the newly created principal components.
As a closure, the customers were grouped in four main categories:
# First Customers cluster (Transactors): Those are customers who pay least amount of intrerest charges and careful with their money, Cluster with lowest balance ($104) and cash advance ($303), Percentage of full payment = 23%
# Second customers cluster (revolvers) who use credit card as a loan (most lucrative sector): highest balance ($5000) and cash advance (~$5000), low purchase frequency, high cash advance frequency (0.5), high cash advance transactions (16) and low percentage of full payment (3%)
# Third customer cluster (VIP/Prime): high credit limit $16K and highest percentage of full payment, target for increase credit limit and increase spending habits
# Fourth customer cluster (low tenure): these are customers with low tenure (7 years), low balance 
Accordingly, multiple kinds of graph plots were done in order to understand the behavior of the respective groups of customers.
